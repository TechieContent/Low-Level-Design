**Low Level Design (LLD) Patterns & Real-World Systems:**

For each system design code file in this repository, you’ll find a comment at the top linking to my corresponding Medium article. That article provides:

1. The complete UML diagram for the system
2. Key features and flow explanation
3. Description of the design choices and challenges
4. Relationships between core classes
5. Interview tips and extension suggestions
This collection is meant to be both a code reference and a guided learning path for low-level (object-oriented) design.

**Systems Included**

The repo currently covers (with links to Medium articles in the code comments):

1. Parking Lot System
2. Movie Ticket Booking System
3. Hotel Booking System
4. Splitwise-like Expense Sharing App
5. Ride Sharing App (Uber/Lyft style)
(More coming soon!)

**For each, simply:**

. Open the relevant code file
. Follow the Medium article link at the top for an in-depth explanation, UML diagram, and class relationship breakdown
